Mintlify supports in-line [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) by surrounding your LaTeX code with dollar signs (\$). For example, `$(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$` will render as $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$.

Equations on their own line can be created with double dollar signs (\$\$):

$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$

```md
$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$
```
