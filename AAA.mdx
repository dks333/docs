## Git and update workflows

### Git basics

While Web Editor means you don’t need to go to GitHub or your command line to make
changes, it’s still helpful to know the basics of git.

Git terminology:

- **Repository**: The folder in which your code lives. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (like GitHub).

- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.
