This is a [testing](https://google.com) file

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

**Step 1**: Install the Mintlify CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```


```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `docs.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

Alternatively, if you do not want to install the CLI globally, you can use a run a one-time script:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx mintlify dev
```


```bash yarn
yarn dlx mintlify dev
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx mintlify dev
```

</CodeGroup>

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Updates

Each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```


```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm up --global mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Custom Ports

By default, the CLI uses port 3000. You can customize the port using the `--port` flag. To run the CLI on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Additional Commands

While `mintlify dev` is the most commonly used command, there are other commands you can use to manage your documentation.

### Find Broken Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

### Check OpenAPI Spec

You can use the CLI to check your OpenAPI file for errors using the following command:

```bash
mintlify openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>
```

You can pass in a filename (e.g. `./openapi.yaml`) or a URL (e.g. `https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json`).

### Renaming Files

You can rename files using the following command:

```bash
mintlify rename <oldFilename> <newFilename>
```

This is an improvement over updating the filename normally as it will also update all references to the file, ensuring no broken links.

## Formatting

While developing locally, we recommend using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX.

If you use Cursor, Windsurf, or VSCode, we recommend the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

If you use JetBrains, we recommend the [MDX IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and setting up [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/webstorm) for code formatting.
