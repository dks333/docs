# Security Testing Overview

This section contains a comprehensive suite of iframe security tests designed to evaluate potential vulnerabilities and security boundaries when MDX content is embedded in iframes.

## Test Categories

Our security testing is organized into the following categories:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Iframe Detection"
    icon="window-maximize"
    href="/security/iframe-detection"
  >
    Basic window properties and iframe detection mechanisms
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="Parent Access"
    icon="hierarchy"
    href="/security/parent-access"
  >
    Attempts to access parent window properties and methods
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="DOM Manipulation"
    icon="code"
    href="/security/dom-manipulation"
  >
    Tests for manipulating parent document elements
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="Navigation Hijacking"
    icon="route"
    href="/security/navigation-hijacking"
  >
    Frame busting and navigation redirection attempts
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="Cross-Frame Communication"
    icon="messages"
    href="/security/communication"
  >
    PostMessage and cross-frame communication testing
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="Storage & Cookies"
    icon="database"
    href="/security/storage-cookies"
  >
    Local storage, session storage, and cookie access tests
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to Use

Each test file contains JavaScript code that will automatically run when the MDX file is loaded in an iframe. The tests will:

1. **Log detailed results** to the browser console
2. **Attempt various security bypasses** and report success/failure
3. **Provide visual feedback** when possible
4. **Test both read and write operations** across security boundaries

## Safety Notice

<Warning>
These tests are designed for educational and security assessment purposes only. They should be used in controlled environments to understand iframe security boundaries and should not be used maliciously.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

To run the security tests:

1. Load any of the security test files in an iframe
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Check the console for detailed test results
4. Look for messages indicating successful bypasses or blocked attempts

Each test will clearly indicate whether it succeeded (✅) or was blocked (❌) by security mechanisms.
